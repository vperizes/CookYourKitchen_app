# [Cook Your Kitchen](https://cookyourkitchen.onrender.com/)
Cook your Kitchen is a recipe finder web app that is powered by [Edamam's recipe search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api). 
As someone that loves cooking but also prioritizes shopping for seasonal foods I often find myself needing a little inspiration when it comes to combining random ingredients. Cook your Kitchen was my personal solution to that problem. The website is publicly hosted onrender.com.

Use `npm i` to install all package/dependencies after cloning or forking the project.
